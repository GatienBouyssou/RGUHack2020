# RGUHack2020

This Project was done for the RGUHack 2020 event. The goal ? Create a instrument in 24 hours. Mission accepted !!! 

Our idea was to create a drum table where you could record sounds and put them on keys so that in the end you could play weird and fun music. Was the mission a success ? Absolutely not, but we had fun. 

Has a consolation price, we give you this little but working piano. Have fun !
